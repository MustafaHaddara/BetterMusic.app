## Operation
### Now Playing
The Now Playing view displays information about the currently playing song.

The three buttons in the center, above the album art, are playback controls. In order from left to right, the buttons correspond to the actions: "Go to Previous Song", "Play/Pause Current Song", "Go to Next Song".

Below the album art, the song title, artist, and album are displayed. Below that information, there is a slider to control the output volume, where dragging the slider to the left will decrease the volume, and dragging the slider to the right will increase the volume.

Below the volume slider are the queue modification controls. The left-most button toggles "Repeat" on and off, and the right-most button toggles "Shuffle" on and off. The center button will take the user to the Queue view (when there are songs queued to be played next) and will display the phrase "No songs in Queue" when the queue is empty.

## Source Code
Source code available at: https://github.com/MustafaHaddara/BetterMusicApp/archive/master.zip
To run from source, download and extract the zip file and then open the file "index.html" in a web browser (ie. Google Chrome).

Typically this can be done by double-clicking on the file. However, if you have configured a different kind of application to open html files (such as a text editor, for example) then you may drag and drop the "index.html" file into an open web browser window.
